# LOG-bestiaire-musical
Arduino project to automate a remote-controled shadow puppet show for the [Bestiaire Musical](http://www.lesondesgalantes.com/programme-2017/) project of the french baroque music group [Les Ondes Galantes](http://www.lesondesgalantes.com/).

The first version was used for the summer concerts of 2017, the second one (including a remote control) was used for the 2017 french patrimony days (2017/09/16-17).
